                    <p class="col-md-6">Hello! My name is Lander Jarvis Viernes. Currently, I am an 11th grader at Waipahu High School, and am part of the class of 2025. To most people, I am known for my outstanding grades and academic achievement in school each year. My hobbies are mainly playing video games and surfing the internet. I'm a very shy person usually, but lately I have tried to open up to other people more. My number one goal is to have fun, because I want enjoying life to be a motivator for me to do the best I can in whatever I do.</p>

                    <h2 class="display-2 col-md-6">Career Objective: Software Engineer</h2>
                    <p class="col-md-6">In the future, I would like to become a software engineer. Video games were a significant part of my life when I was growing up, so I have been inspired by them to create digital applications and learn how to code. In Waipahu High School, I chose the pathway of Cyber, formerly known as the Academy of Information of Technology, because I knew I wanted to get into Computer Science. I also took an Intro to Computer Science, or ICS 111, from the school's Early College program to further my knowledge in programming and coding.</p>

                        <h6 class="display-6 rounded-3 bg-dark bg-gradient text-light p-3">Challenge Myself Academically</h6>
                        <p>Over the course of my education in high school, I have tried to test my limits in academics, including participating in Math Team, and especially taking AP courses. No matter what I take, I always strive to get a grade of A at the very end of the year.</p>
                        <h6 class="display-6 rounded-3 bg-dark bg-gradient text-light p-3">Get Accepted Into College</h6>
                        <p>My plan is to get into a 4-year college so that I can major in Computer Science. The colleges I am looking at currently are UCLA, Cal Poly, Caltech, and USC. A lot of work has to have the requirements and apply for the colleges I want to, and academically challenging myself is one of the ways I can build my applicationd to show the best of what I can do.</p>
